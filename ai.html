            <h2>AI : A Buzzword</i></h2>
            <p> "AI is cool, AI is creative.” “Ai is <i>genius</i>, AI is creator.” “Ai is our final Invention, Ai is a
                moral
                obligation.” “Ai is the <i>violence,</i> Ai is the war”. AI is like a magic trick, constantly surprising
                us
                with its wonders. The AI boom will boost the game and AI bubble is about to blast. AI will enhance human
                potential and create new opportunities for growth and innovation. <i>“AI is a future, It will kill us
                    all.”</i>
            </p>

                <h2>What the heck is Ai?</h2>
                <p> Artificial Intelligence (AI): The Matter of Death in the Digital Age. <i>But what is it?</i> It
                    sound like a weird question, but it's one that's never been more intriguing. Here's the short
                    answer: "AI is like having a supercharged digital brain that learns and thinks on its own. It’s
                    the tech behind everything from smart assistants to self-driving cars, making our lives easier
                    and more connected by handling tasks and solving problems with impressive speed and smarts."<br><br>
                    Everyone wants AI, everyone is interested in AI, everyone likes AI, everyone busys things with
                    AI-AI, AI, AI.</p>

                <h2> But why was "nobody" talking about it before that?</h2>
                <p>Where did this <i>"sudden"</i> hype come from? The AI tsunami that has been following us since the
                    end of November 2022 is no coincidence.</p>
                <h3>If you want an answer to these questions:</h3>
                <p> 1. Why is AI hyped right now?<br>
                    2. Why wasn't ai hyped before?
